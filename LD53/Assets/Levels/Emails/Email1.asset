  Body: 'Congratulations on your new job! If it''s alright with you, we''ll just
    hit the ground running here with your first assignment. It''ll be an easy one:
    deliver a pizza to Italy. Now, we''re a little behind schedule, here, so you
    won''t have a lot of time to land and take the pizza to them. Come to think of
    it, we''re usually behind schedule. Just drop it out of the plane with the spacebar.
    You''ll have to get it in the marked area for it to count. If you miss, press
    ''R'' to retry. You can also use spacebar to start the mission. Okay! Good luck!'

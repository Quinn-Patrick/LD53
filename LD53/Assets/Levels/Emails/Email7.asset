  Subject: 'Subject: It''s an emergency!'
  Body: This next one's urgent! There was an avalanche in the Swiss alps, and a skier
    is stranded in an ice cave! We're carrying precious cargo essential for his survival.
    This one comes with a parachute, which makes it fall slower and allows you to
    adjust its trajectory with the arrow keys. The parachute will break off if you
    hit anything or press the spacebar.

  Body: Wow! You completed every delivery! That's right, there's nothing left to
    deliver! Not one thing! What an accomplishment. For better or worse, this game
    was made in 48 hours by Quinn_Patrick for Ludum Dare 53. The theme was Delivery
    or Delivered or something like that. It looks like this on purpose I swear I
    can draw better if I try please don't bully me.

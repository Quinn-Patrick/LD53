  From: 'From: Your New Employer'
  Subject: 'Subject: Put on your moon shoes.'
  Body: Due to a miscalculation in the material composition of the lunar surface
    soil, the moon base now faces a food shortage. They also built their door really
    high up. Thankfully, they were thoughtful enough to put a big purple trampoline
    out front. Drop the package on the trampoline, and make sure that it has enough
    forward momentum to get inside. Good luck.

  Body: Nice job delivering that pizza. I'm sure they'll get that tower stood back
    up soon. I've already got more work for you. Another easy one. The pharoah needs
    a grand new tomb, and you have to drop it down in the middle of the desert. There
    might be some moving bars in the way, just try to avoid them. You can speed up
    and slow down by pressing left and right. When you drop the package, it will
    follow your trajectory, so if you're holding right, the package will mostly fall
    straight down, but if you're holding right, it will fly farther forward than
    normal.

  Body: Some old codger with a pointy hat needs us to jam something in a rock so
    his scrawny nephew can pull it out and become king of something. His email was
    lacking in specifics, so I just picked something that I thought would fit in
    the hole. It's a pretty narrow target, so you may have to slow down and aim carefully.
